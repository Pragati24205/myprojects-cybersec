## Hi, I’m Pragati 👋

I’m a Computer Science student focused on cybersecurity and web security testing.  
Currently I'm learning by solving labs, writing scripts, and breaking things to understand how they work.

Areas of interest:
- Web application security
- Authentication & access control
- Python scripting for pentesting

This GitHub is a work-in-progress log of my learning.
